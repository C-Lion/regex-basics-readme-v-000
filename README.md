## Introduction

Regular expressions are an extremely powerful way to search through strings and blocks of text for specific patterns. They can be used for data validation, searching, mass file renaming, and finding records in a database. Use them carefully - they are like a surgeon's scalpel: Able to do a lot of harm or good, depending on how well it is wielded.

In this lesson, we're going to learn the syntax and basic vocabulary of regular expressions. We'll start simple and build from there. A great place to head for Regex testing and practice is [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) - it allows you to build and test regular expressions against text that you define.
